## About 
Hi! This is Jenny, a 2nd year uni student who likes nerdy stuff amongst lots of other things. Here's my CV.

## Name of this site
When I was in high school, me and a bunch of physics-loving friends had a discord group, in which we each named our alias after something from the standard model. Mine was Neutrino, and the name stuck ever since. So this page is named Neutrino's ArXiv (vx for short), with ArXiv referencing the research paper depository.
